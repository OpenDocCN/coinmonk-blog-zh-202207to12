We are very fortunate that we received the help of ACDS, a financial product design expert from Augustin Institution in the United Kingdom, in August to improve and upgrade the final version of the original economic model. A good mathematical model to support the operation of the system, in fact, this is a big challenge, we are facing the urgent expectations of tens of thousands of users, in many countries such as India, Vietnam, the United States, Singapore and other countries, our fans are looking forward to seeing our products. At the same time, our partners of various trading platforms are also warming up and paving the way for our arrival. We are honored that we have received a lot of support and help at this stage. To make ourselves pay more attention to the safety and rationality of our products, we understand that we are doing an unprecedented thing, that is, a metaverse financial center full of mathematical formulas and economic concepts such as DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Model) Built on a decentralized public chain, the economic infrastructure and the issuance of core assets are completed through smart contracts. At the same time, NFT exchanges are opened in our ecosystem, and we are also actively contacting more NFT issuers to come. Our NFT exchange issues, lists and trades NFTs. We hope that DIffusion Metafi will be an active asset issuance and circulation center. More importantly, we have implemented the DAO and incentive model and organizational model through smart contracts for the first time. The organization of DiffusionDAO is The DAO organization is not an organizational egalitarianism. We believe that everyone who contributes to the ecology should get higher rights, that is, have higher rights to mint assets in DiffusionDAO METAFI. All of this runs on the decentralized public chain, which is more scientific and reasonable, but at the same time it also poses greater challenges to our implementation. We are very proud of our technical team. Under the requirements of the complex model, developers all over the world worked hard to develop our DiffusionDAO METAFI. After the fourth collective test, we can finally meet with fans around the world in the near future. We have mentioned in past articles that the primary goal of DiffusionDAO is to become a joint reserve system for web3, to build a set of the most fair and reasonable financial center with unlimited prospects in the form of DEFI, and to issue corresponding digital assets for use in the upcoming The web3 or the Metaverse is the foreshadowing of the economic system. At the same time, we have not only designed and implemented in the field of metaverse finance, but also done a lot of work on the combination of metaverse virtualization and AI, which we named Make Stable Diffusion — Stable Diffusion is a kind of AI-generated text-to-image diffusion model, capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input, will evolve to generate video in the next version, and in the current version can pass a trained AI Constructing incredible images, the multi-parallel ability enables billions of people to create stunning art in seconds. We are working together to release it publicly as soon as possible. Stable DIffusion is led by Patrick Esser of Runway and Robin Rombach of the Research Group for Machine Vision and Learning at the University of Munich (former CompVis Lab at Heidelberg University), and Make Stable Diffusion is based on a collaboration with Clarence in Germany. A text-to-image AI model integrated with the WEB3 system that will enable billions of people to build their own metaverse in the future without paying high costs and spending a lot of time learning the basics. This is a breakthrough in speed and quality, and the change in this version is that it can run on consumer-grade GPUs, which may lead to a POW system that creates metaverse space. You can see some amazing outputs created by this model without preprocessing or postprocessing on the upcoming page. The model itself builds on the work of the CompVis and Runway teams and <br/>Derek’s upgrades in their widely used latent diffusion model, incorporating our lead generative AI developers Emlyn, PUT UP AI’s Gabriel, Google Brain’s Hiram based on insights from the conditional diffusion model and many other staff. We are very happy that the field of artificial intelligence generated media can meet the world. At the same time, as an important infrastructure of the Diffusion multiverse, we believe that MAKE STABLE DIffusion will greatly empower our overall ecology, and on this basis, many new Great AI artist, and hope that in this way, it can bring a very creative gift to all. MAKE Stable Diffusion runs with 10 GB of VRAM on a consumer-grade GPU, producing a 512x512 pixel image in seconds. This will allow researchers and the public to run it under one-touch conditions, making image generation more democratized. We look forward to building more open ecosystems and more advanced models around this to really explore the boundaries of the potential creative metaverse. As we prepare for the upcoming public release, we hope to have more volunteers participating in our tests and providing more insights. This will help the AI ​​system we are currently training to get more correct templates and results. We believe that the mature make stable DIffusion can fully unleash the potential of human beings. We will also open synthetic datasets based on these outputs for further study. Our goal is to set new standards of collaboration and reproducibility for the models we create and support, and will share our results in the coming months. We hope that more volunteers can join our ecology, whether it is in the development of the Metaverse economy, in the construction of the DAO organization or in the creation of virtual scenes, we believe that every participant will benefit from it.</p><figure class="jc jd je jf fq iu fe ff paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="iv iw di ix bf iy"><div class="fe ff ke"><img src="../Images/289399db3ce8bd78887ed467c64cacad.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*5f4zVMzTLNlaADYVfwqIwg.png"/></div></div></figure><figure class="jc jd je jf fq iu fe ff paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="iv iw di ix bf iy"><div class="fe ff ke"><img src="../Images/4367d2dbe3a3f9bf0b982b05594e8112.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*_OAkQC0Wm2IarWgiyvL31Q.png"/></div></div></figure><blockquote class="kf"><p id="7361" class="kg kh ht bd ki kj kk kl km kn ko kd ek translated">交易新手？试试<a class="ae kp" rel="noopener" href="/coinmonks/crypto-trading-bot-c2ffce8acb2a">加密交易机器人</a>或者<a class="ae kp" rel="noopener" href="/coinmonks/top-10-crypto-copy-trading-platforms-for-beginners-d0c37c7d698c">复制交易</a></p></blockquote></div></div>
